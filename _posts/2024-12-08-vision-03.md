*Quotes I like:*
* *"But I'm telling you, these walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized."*
* *"Forget that... there are places in this world that aren't made out of stone. That there's something inside... that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours." "What're you talking about?" "Hope."*
* *"Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."*
* *"I hope."*
