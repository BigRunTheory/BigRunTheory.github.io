I am an Applied Scientist with hands-on expertise in Agentic AI systems, LLM fine-tuning and evaluation, large-scale optimization, and end-to-end ML for autonomous decision-making. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from **[Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE)** at **[Purdue Univesity](http://www.purdue.edu)**, where I worked with **[Professor Andrew Liu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Intel2Grid/about)** in the field of **Operations Research**.

During my Ph.D. study, my research interests mainly focused on devevloping **distributed algorithms** for solving **large-scale optimization problems** with applicaitons to machine learning models and energy systems. For my latest works, please refer to my ***[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GEqMbqEAAAAJ&hl=en)***.

Before pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I obatined my B.S. degree from **[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)**, majoring in **Physics**.

I am also a lifelong follower of ***[Buddha's teaching](https://bigruntheory.github.io/teaching/)***.
