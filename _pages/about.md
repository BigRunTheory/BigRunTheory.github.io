I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at [Purdue Univesity](http://www.purdue.edu), where I worked with [Professor Andrew Liu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Intel2Grid/about) in the field of Operations Research.

During my Ph.D. study, my research interests mainly focused on devevloping **distributed algorithms** for solving **large-scale optimization problems** with applicaitons to machine learning models and energy systems. For my latest works, please refer to my [publications page](https://bigruntheory.github.io/publications/).

Before pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I obatined my B.S. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Theoretical Physics.

I am also a lifelong follower of [Buddha's teaching](https://bigruntheory.github.io/teaching/).
